# Control Flow Lab

We can now practise creating your own projects in Intellij and writing some code which uses control flow.

## MVP

Open Intellij and create a new project (`File > New > Project`). 

Please ensure that you have selected `New Project` in your left-hand nav,  `Java` as your language, and `Maven` as your build system. Your JDK should be `17 Oracle OpenJDK version 17.x.x`.

We usually recommend opening new projects in a new window. 

Right-click on your blue java folder and create a new Java class. 

Insert a `main()` method inside your class so that you can run your code.

### Guessing game (secret number)
Create a simple number guessing game, that takes in some user input matches it to a 'secret' number. 

The program should indicate if an incorrect guess is too high or too low. It should, of course, let the user know if they have guessed the number correctly.

## Extension

### What should I wear?
> You may wish to create a new class for this, with its own `main()` method.

Create a program that makes suggestions on what to wear based on information it gathers about the weather. The purpose of this exercise is to give you some practise with logical and conditional operators.

Allow your program to collect some descriptive user input about the weather ("rainy", "sunny", "cloudy", "snow", etc) and the average temperature for the day (8, 18, 28, etc).

Let your program output clothing suggestions depending on a combination of weather conditions and temperature.

e.g. if it is both "rainy" and less than 12 degrees, output "wear a waterproof winter coat"


### Tips/Notes
We do not expect you to use arrays/arraylists or loops (of any kind) in these exercises.

Please do not copy/paste! It's a terrible habit and will lead to bugs (guaranteed).


## More Git & GitHub practise
When you have finished, stage (`git add .`), commit (`git commit -m"message here"`), and push (`git push...`) your program to GitHub.

> Ensure you have created a remote repository on GitHub to push your code to.

Use the lab submission form (bookmarked in Slack) to share your GitHub link with us and to let us know how you got on with the afternoon lab.
